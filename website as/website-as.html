			<h1>Website as</h1>

			<p class="p1">My website is an open field full of rice paper screens.</p><br>

			<p class="p2">I can create spatial subdivisons with ease, or "rooms" within rooms.</p><br>

			<p class="p1">I can leave clear pathways from one "room" to the next, or make things more hidden.</p><br>

			<p class="p2">The field, being a large expanse, allows the possibility for me to create as many more rooms as I wish.</p><br>

			<p class="p1">The rooms are open-air; breeze flows in and out from other parts of the world, and my rooms are inherently interconnected with it.</p><br>

			<p class="p2">The rooms are open to the public; anyone is welcome to walk through.</p><br>

			<p class="p1">I can take anything I want from the world and place it in my open-air rooms, or I could spend time to cultivate something from the ground.</p><br>
