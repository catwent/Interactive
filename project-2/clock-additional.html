<!--1. On page load, get the time since the clock has started.

I learned that the internal clock in JavaScript starts midnight January 1, 1970. So for ease, this can be the start time of the clock.

 -->

function getMilliseconds() {
  let d = new Date();
  let timeMs = d.getTime();
}








<!-- 2. Take the image, and figure out how many characters there are total.

Number of characters in ASCII:
160x120 = 19200 characters

-->








<!-- 3. With some math, translate amount of time since midnight 1970/01/01  to the equivalent # of characters- since 0.

Length of a day on Mars:
24 hours, 37 minutes, and 22 seconds =
86400s + 2220s + 22s = 88642000 milliseconds

Therefore, code should do following:
timeMs divided by 8864200;
take the remainder of that division, figure out what percentage of 8864200 that is;
then use that percentage to calculate the equivalent number of characters out of 19200;

-->

function getNumCharacters(){
    let remaind = timeMs % 88642000;
    let prctgMarsDay = remaind / 88642000;
    let dispNumCharacters = prctgMarsDay * 19200;
}








<!-- 4. Use a for loop to display each character up to the current one, on page load.

I took the loops Treehouse course and still don't know how to accomplish this with a for loop!!! Can you point me to an example of a for loop that works similarly?

-->








<!-- 5. Then set your interval to display the next character after the specified amount of time, and so on.

Should display 1 character every 4646.77 milliseconds, or round down to 4646 milliseconds, to complete the ASCII cycle in just UNDER 88642000 milliseconds (Mars day length) so that script doesn't clear and restart before ASCII finishes printing.

The delay function is already in the code  on line 98, and it is working. Right now the delay value is set to 2 so as to be very very quick for preview purposes, but it sohuld be 4646. I don't know how to incorporate that with the rest of this.

-->









<!-- 6. After 88642000 milliseconds, clear the page and restart script

I'm not 100% sure if this is correct or should instead use setTimeout/clearTimeout or setInterval/clearInterval.

-->

setTimeout(function() {
      $('#mars').reset();
    }, 88642000);
