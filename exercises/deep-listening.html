 A throbbing, whirring, white noise coming from my right underlines a higher pitched, constant cool pink noise. My refrigerator is the loudest sound in this quiet space. Now staccato keys typing this note. Infrequent percussion of neighbors closing doors and kitchen cabinets.

 A woman in the building next door is a convincing actress; I can hear her reciting a passionate monologue in which she seems troubled. I’d believe she really were if I haven’t heard her practicing scales and singing operatic numbers on different days.

I find Kate Crawford's writing interesting, as the only social media side I 'actively' use is Reddit, where my username and identity are anonymous. I am largely what is called a 'lurker,' usually only reading people's posts on subs that interest me, only occasionally upvoting and (even more rarely) commenting when I feel I have something useful to contribute.

And there is accountability with your 'peers' in the form of moderation. Thusly, I find a lot of kindness and empathy
